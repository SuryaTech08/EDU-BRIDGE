# EduBridge – Interactive Learning Platform
Project Description:

EduBridge is an integrated digital learning platform designed to make education more engaging, interactive, and accessible for students. The platform combines multiple learning tools into a single ecosystem to eliminate the confusion caused by using separate applications for communication, learning materials, assessments, and virtual classes.

EduBridge focuses on enhancing student engagement through real-time interaction, collaborative learning, and centralized educational resources. By merging features similar to Google Meet, Google Classroom, WhatsApp discussions, and interactive quiz tools, it provides a modern and streamlined learning experience.
